# OFDM_64QAM_Python

This is my project from Digital Communication course at KMITL.

Most code and concept is from https://dspillustrations.com/pages/posts/misc/python-ofdm-example.html. 

**Our changes**
- We changed 4 bits per symbol (16 QAM) to 8 bits per symbol (64 QAM).
- We changed input data from random bit (original) to the image that is needed to be preprocessed before transmitting, and we also use a CRC encoder.
- We visualized OFDM in the time-frequency domain for more understanding.

This project was made by Kornthum Seetanathum and Natchaya Sricom. 
We will be glad if this project could help whoever is looking for OFDM code in python. If you have any suggestions, feel free to give us advice.
